Achievement Bot is a simple and asthetically pleasing form app for users to add and track their achievements to boost confidence and combat Imposter Syndrome.

The future goal of this app will be to add an integration in Zapier to connect with other apps to easily add these achievements. This app will also integrate with Slack/SMS/Email to then send a random achievement daily to remind users of their great accomplishements!
